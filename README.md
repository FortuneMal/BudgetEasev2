‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation (Local Development)
Follow these steps to get BudgetEase up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm: Download and Install Node.js (npm is included).

MongoDB: Download and Install MongoDB Community Server or set up a free MongoDB Atlas cluster.

Git: Download and Install Git.

Git Bash (Windows): Recommended for consistent terminal experience.

1. Clone the Repository
Open your Git Bash terminal and clone the project:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/BudgetEasev2.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
cd BudgetEasev2

2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

cd backend
npm install

Create a .env file in the backend directory:

PORT=3001
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/budgetease # Or your MongoDB Atlas URI
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here # Generate a strong, random string
CURRENCY_API_KEY=your_exchange_rate_api_key # Get from exchangerate-api.com

MONGO_URI: If using local MongoDB, ensure mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/budgetease is correct. If using MongoDB Atlas, paste your connection string here.

JWT_SECRET: Crucial for security. Generate a long, random string.

CURRENCY_API_KEY: Sign up for a free API key at ExchangeRate-API and paste it here.

Run the Backend Server:

node server.js

The terminal should show: Backend server listening at http://localhost:3001 and MongoDB Connected: localhost (or your Atlas host). Keep this terminal open.

3. MongoDB Setup
If you are using a local MongoDB instance:

Open a new Git Bash terminal.

Navigate to your MongoDB bin directory (e.g., cd "/c/Program Files/MongoDB/Server/7.0/bin").

Start the MongoDB daemon:

./mongod.exe --dbpath /data/db # Or your custom dbpath

Ensure you have created the /data/db directory or specify an existing one.

The terminal should show "Waiting for connections". Keep this terminal open.

4. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

cd ../frontend # Go back to the root, then into frontend
npm install

Create a .env file in the frontend directory:

VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001

This tells your frontend where to find your backend API.

Run the Frontend Development Server:

npm run dev

The terminal should show: ‚ûú Local: http://localhost:5173/. Keep this terminal open.

5. Register a User
Before logging in, you need to register a user in your MongoDB database via the backend API.

Open a new Git Bash terminal.

Run the curl command (ensure your backend server is running):

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Test User", "username": "testuser", "password": "password123"}' http://localhost:3001/api/users/register

You should see a JSON response with the new user's details and a JWT token.

üöÄ Usage
Access the Application: Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5173/.

Login: Use the credentials of the user you registered (e.g., username: testuser, password: password123).

Explore:

Dashboard: Get an overview of your finances, currency converter, and notifications.

Expenses: Add, view, edit, and delete your daily expenses.

Budgets: Set up and manage budgets for different categories and time periods.

Goals: Create and track your progress towards savings goals.

‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment (High-Level Overview)
For production, you would typically deploy your application to cloud platforms:

Database: MongoDB Atlas (as covered in Phase 5).

Backend: Render.com (for Node.js Express applications).

Frontend: Netlify (for static React applications).

Remember to update environment variables (MONGO_URI, VITE_BACKEND_URL, CORS origin) on your chosen deployment platforms.
